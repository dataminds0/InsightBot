(The One Big Beautiful Bill Act did, however, crack down harshly on tax credits for wind and solar, carrying out part of Trump’s campaign promise.) The fossil fuel industry also benefits financially from not having to address the negative side effects of their products: coal companies don’t have to deal with the health impacts from people breathing polluted air, for example, while oil and gas companies don’t need to think about damages from extreme weather juiced up by climate change caused by their product.",US Taxpayers Will Pay Billions in New Fossil Fuel Subsidies Thanks to the Big Beautiful Bill,en,economy,Positive

Thus, it’s worth speculating that Ford may be outsourcing some of its external communications operations, at least, in the U.S. That particular social media platform has proven to be an effective advertising space, as well as a way to connect with owners and enthusiasts in recent years, so it’ll be interesting to see if a new company comes along and how it will approach content creation for The Blue Oval.",Ford Wipes Past Content From Major Instagram Accounts,en,social,Positive
