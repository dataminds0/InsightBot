    "# News Article Classification and Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook performs a comprehensive analysis of news articles, encompassing language detection, context classification, headline extraction, and sentiment analysis. It leverages various NLP techniques and pre-trained models to categorize and summarize textual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The key steps include:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Data Loading and Cleaning:** Loading the dataset from a CSV file and preprocessing the text content.\n",
    "2.  **Language Detection:** Identifying the language of each article using the `langdetect` library.\n",
    "3.  **Context Classification:** Assigning context labels (e.g., Political, Economy, Technology, Social) to articles using keyword-based weak labeling and transformer-based zero-shot classification.\n",
    "4.  **Headline Extraction:** Generating concise headlines for articles using summarization pipelines.\n",
    "5.  **Sentiment Analysis:** Determining the sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral) of articles using TextBlob and VADER sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook explores different models and methods for context classification, headline extraction, and sentiment analysis, comparing their performance and trade-offs. The final output includes the original content, extracted headlines, predicted context, detected language, and sentiment scores for each article."

When Francois Bayrou, the latest ill-fated inhabitant of France’s prime ministerial residence, the Matignon, stepped aside after calling for his own doomed confidence vote (leading many commentators to describe it as jumping ship), headlines in France have turned to his successor. No knight in shining armor appeared – Macron is now on his seventh prime minister, so viable candidates are getting harder to find. According to Lazar, Lecornu offers some compromise – he is a right-wing politician yet still a figure of what the French call, “Social Gaullism,” conservative politicians who aren’t afraid to hike taxes, unlike Macron’s focus on pro-business policies.",

The Iskander 9M727 missile that struck the building did not explode, most likely because it was damaged by Ukrainian air defenses, Vladyslav Vlasiuk, Ukraine’s presidential commissioner for sanctions policy, said on Tuesday. Infineon Technologies, the German company that now owns American-based Cypress Semiconductor – one of the manufacturers listed – told CNN that it has taken “extensive measures” to ensure its items don’t end up in Russia. Vlasiuk said that even though this particular missile still included dozens of Western-made parts, it contained fewer such components compared to missiles analyzed earlier in the war.",

         "This was, however, another avant-garde creation by Louis Souvestre, the self-described “hairfreak” who continues to walk a fine line between hairstyling and sculpture. No detail was overlooked, with two thin braids even dangling down and disappearing into the singers’ low-rise burgundy pants, like jack cables. With her forthcoming album “Vie” expected to be heavily 1980s-inspired, the look was, in part, a piece of clever marketing. Styled by Kyle Luu and sporting head-to-toe Dolce & Gabbana, the LA-based “global girl group” Katseye showed precisely how it’s done.",

         "Italy’s most famous film festival has drawn to a close. The 82nd edition of the Venice Film Festival, which concluded on September 6, presented a showcase of hotly anticipated films such as “Bugonia” by the Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos, “Frankenstein” by Guillermo Del Toro, and “Jay Kelly” by Noah Baumbach. Italian actor Alba Rohrwacher wore a custom deep blue satin dress designed by Jonathan Anderson for Dior (his first womenswear collection for the brand is scheduled to debut at Paris Fashion Week in October). Similarly, Louise Trotter’s vision for Italian label Bottega Veneta can already be seen on Jacob Elordi and Vicky Krieps, while Ayo Edebiri wore Chanel designed by the French house’s new creative director Matthieu Blazy.",

         "Nearly three years apart in age, the two sisters were extraordinarily close; so close that their mother once said, “if Cassandra’s head had been going to be cut off, Jane would have hers cut off too.” As Kalika Sands, Sotheby’s Head of Books and Manuscripts New York, notes, they had an “incredibly close emotional bond” as well as a “very strong intellectual bond.” This relationship is evident in the letters they wrote to each other. In this one, Austen rattles through an account of her days in Bath, gossips about their neighbors and relatives, shares news about their friends, pokes fun at Cassandra’s ill health, and laments the family’s diminished social status. It was written about three months after Austen’s father died, Sands told CNN, quoting a passage that shows the changed social circles the family moved in and “how reduced Jane Austen felt.” “Seven years and four months ago, we went to the same riding house to see Miss Lefroy’s performance,” Austen wrote. No letters from the period three or four years before this letter was written have survived, Sands said, pointing out this was a time when Austen wasn’t very productive, struggled with her family’s move to Bath and was perhaps depressed, as some critics have hypothesized.",

         "A lightning-sparked wildfire in California’s Sierra National Forest burned Tuesday through a grove of giant sequoias and set some of the ancient towering trees on fire. To protect the majestic trees, some estimated to be 3,000 years old, fire crews laid sprinkler lines to increase ground moisture, wrapped the trunks with fire-resistant foil blankets, raked flammable material away from trees and patrolled the area looking for hotspots, he said. The giant trees rely on low-intensity fire to help open their cones to disperse seeds, and flames clear undergrowth so seedlings can take root and get sunlight. The blaze has scorched 85 square miles of grass, chaparral and timber in a remote area known for camping and hiking about 60 miles east of Fresno.",

The California Gold Rush brought thousands of Chinese miners to the United States, where they faced anti-immigrant sentiments and persecution that included an exorbitant Foreign Miners Tax designed to drive them away from mining. The town, which also served as a backdrop for multiple films , was added to California’s Historical Landmarks list in 1949.
