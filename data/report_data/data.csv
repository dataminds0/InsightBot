To explain away the paucity of tangible contacts between insurgents in Iraq and Osama bin Laden’s organization, the remnants of which were now scattered around Pakistan and Yemen, McChrystal and his aides redefined al-Qaeda as a concentric grouping of decentralized “franchises” operating on a “blind cell model.” In his memoir, McChrystal admits with remarkable if belated frankness that JSOC produced intelligence assessments “that inflated al-Qaeda’s role,” and “problematically used ‘AQI’ as a catchall designation for any Sunni group that attacked Americans.” This narrative, he acknowledges, was a way to “sidestep the reality” that most Iraqi insurgents were primarily motivated by “earthly grievances,” not Islamist ideology. By grossly exaggerating Zarqawi’s importance, McChrystal and his deputy, Vice Admiral William McRaven, convinced the Bush administration that it was possible for the United States to kill its way to victory in Iraq through a massively stepped-up campaign of targeted assassinations.

Qatari prime minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said on Tuesday that the country would continue to mediate between Israel and Hamas, but “for current talks, I do not think there’s something valid right now after what we saw from today’s attack.” “It is difficult to imagine the Qataris picking up where they left off,” said Steven Cook, a senior fellow of the Council on Foreign Relations. “From Doha’s perspective, Qatar has exerted considerable effort to release Israeli hostages only to be repaid with an airstrike on their country.” Egypt could act as mediator instead, Cook said, but it is a “thankless task” when “neither the Israeli government nor the Hamas leadership seem interested in a deal.” “I think it really calls into question what is prime minister Netanyahu’s intention,” said Rachel Brandenburg, Washington Managing Director and Senior Fellow at the Israel Policy Forum, during an episode of a podcast hosted by War on the Rocks .",en,politics,negative

Kirill Dmitriev, head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund and President Putin’s special representative for investment and economic cooperation, has played a key role as a Kremlin negotiator in Moscow’s dealings with the Trump administration regarding Ukraine. On X, Dmitriev reposted Malaysian right-wing political commentator and influencer Ian Miles Cheong’s video montage showing alleged leftists “in full celebration mode over Charlie Kirk getting shot.” Dmitriev also called Kirk a “voice of light” and later retweeted a message from billionaire Elon Musk stating: “The Left is the party of murder.” Also on X, Deputy Security Council Chairman Dmitry Medvedev linked Kirk’s murder to what he called “a variety of left-wing liberal scum who support Banderite Kiev.” He urged right-wing Americans “to realize that by supporting Ukraine, they’re supporting murderers.” Kirk, who held staunchly pro-MAGA views regarding the war in Ukraine, called Volodymyr Zelensky “a puppet of the CIA who marched his own people into a needless slaughter.” He made this statement in the aftermath of Donald Trump’s widely criticized Oval Office confrontation with the Ukrainian president in February 2025. As recently as July 10, however, Kirk was also critical of Vladimir Putin, arguing that Russia’s president “avoids drawing any troops from Moscow or St. Petersburg to keep the ruling elite passively supportive.” Underreported stories.",en,politics,negative

Zelensky reiterates that he’s ready for a bilateral meeting with Putin, naming Austria, Switzerland, and Turkey as potential venues. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov says Putin is prepared to meet with Zelensky once the meeting’s agenda is set — and that the agenda is “not ready at all.” Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov contradicts Trump’s claim that preparations for a Putin–Zelensky meeting were underway, saying “there was no agreement between Putin and Trump on this.” At the press conference concluding his visit to China, Putin says he “has not ruled out” direct talks with the Ukrainian president and invites him to Moscow: “If Zelensky is willing, let him come to Moscow, and such a meeting will take place.” Zelensky rejects Putin’s invitation to Moscow, saying the proposed location indicates the Russian president doesn’t actually want to meet. Speaking at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, Putin claims he’s fully ready to meet with Zelensky but calls Kyiv’s desire for the meeting to take place in a third country an “excessive demand.” “I’ll repeat once again: if someone truly wants to meet with us, we’re ready.",en,politics,negative
